    <p>
        Hello! I am Roland and this is my AngularJS blog.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a web developer. I started learning it around 2004 by myself. I am more into front-end development but PHP
        have always been my favorite. I like to learn and explore new things, experiment and educate myself. I drink a
        lot of coffee and watch YouTube tutorial videos.

        <a href='https://github.com/rolandsze'>GitHub account.</a>
